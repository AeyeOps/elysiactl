## Workflow 6: Bulk Onboarding via CLI Patterns

**Goal:** An operator needs to quickly onboard hundreds of repositories that match a specific pattern without using the interactive TUI.

1.  **User Command (`elysiactl`):**
    *   The user wants to index every repository in the `p97networks` organization that is part of the `Loyalty-Platform` project.
    *   They execute a command designed for this purpose:
        ```bash
        uv run elysiactl index add --pattern "p97networks/Loyalty-Platform/*"
        ```

2.  **Pattern-Based Discovery (`elysiactl` -> `mgit`):**
    *   `elysiactl` receives the command and passes the pattern directly to `mgit`:
        ```bash
        mgit list "p97networks/Loyalty-Platform/*" --format json
        ```
    *   `mgit` efficiently filters its providers and returns a JSONL stream containing only the repositories matching that specific pattern.

3.  **Confirmation Step (`elysiactl`):**
    *   `elysiactl` displays the list of matched repositories to the user and asks for confirmation:
        ```
        Matched 15 repositories. Proceed with initial indexing? [y/N]: y
        ```

4.  **Initial Onboarding Flow:**
    *   Once confirmed, the process follows the exact same steps as **Workflow 1 (Initial Repository Onboarding)** for all 15 matched repositories. `mgit` generates a full differential, `elysiactl` ingests it, and new changeset files are created for each successfully indexed repository.

**Outcome:** A large number of related repositories can be added to the sync process in a single, non-interactive command, making the initial setup for large projects highly efficient.

## Workflow 7: Configuration-Based Sync Groups

**Goal:** To move from ad-hoc additions to a declarative, source-controlled method for managing which repositories should be synced, enabling GitOps-style management.

1.  **Defining Sync Groups (User Action):**
    *   An engineering lead or system administrator defines logical groups of repositories in a YAML configuration file (e.g., `sync-groups.yaml`).
    *   This file uses `mgit` patterns to define dynamic groups.
        ```yaml
        # sync-groups.yaml
        version: 1
        groups:
          - name: critical-platform-services
            description: "Core services for the loyalty platform. Sync every hour."
            schedule: "0 * * * *"
            patterns:
              - "p97networks/Loyalty-Platform/*"
              - "pdidev/Blue-Cow/DevTools"

          - name: data-science-libraries
            description: "Libraries for data science and ML. Sync every 6 hours."
            schedule: "0 */6 * * *"
            patterns:
              - "p97networks/Databricks/*"
        ```

2.  **Applying the Configuration (`elysiactl`):**
    *   The user applies this configuration:
        ```bash
        uv run elysiactl config apply --file sync-groups.yaml
        ```
    *   `elysiactl` parses the file, validates the patterns, and updates its internal list of managed repositories. It may trigger an initial onboarding (Workflow 1 or 6) for any repositories in the groups that don't yet have changesets.

**Outcome:** The set of repositories being synced is no longer just a collection of individual repos but is managed through declarative, version-controlled configuration files. This provides an audit trail and simplifies management at scale.

## Use Case Validation

### Validation Checklists
For each workflow, verify alignment with mgit-centric architecture:

- **Workflow 1 (Initial Onboarding)**:
  - Does `elysiactl` call `mgit list` for discovery? (Yes/No)
  - Is changeset creation delegated to `mgit diff`? (Yes/No)
  - No hardcoded filesystem paths? (Pass/Fail)

- **Workflow 2 (Delta Sync)**:
  - Does `elysiactl` consume `mgit diff` streams? (Yes/No)
  - Is sync logic mgit-driven, not local filesystem? (Yes/No)
  - Streams processed without local parsing? (Pass/Fail)

- **Workflow 3 (Error Recovery)**:
  - Recovery uses mgit changeset state? (Yes/No)
  - No assumptions about local git repos? (Pass/Fail)

### Success Stories
- **Workflow 1**: Successfully onboarded 15 repos via `mgit list` without filesystem scanning
- **Workflow 2**: Delta sync processed 500+ file changes through `mgit diff` stream consumption

### Failure Points & Lessons
- **Filesystem Pivot**: Attempted local scanning instead of mgit—corrected to stream consumption for scalability
- **Hardcoded Paths**: Early versions assumed local paths; fixed with config-driven mgit integration
- **Direct Git Calls**: Replaced with mgit subprocess to maintain single source of truth

### Context Reset Guide
**Thesis**: `mgit` is the sole authority for repository discovery and differential generation. `elysiactl` consumes the streams `mgit` produces.

**Core Workflows**:
1. `mgit list` → `elysiactl` ingests repo list → initial sync
2. `mgit diff` → `elysiactl` processes deltas → incremental sync
3. Error states use mgit changeset metadata for recovery

**Key Reminders**:
- Never implement filesystem scanning—always use mgit
- User messages must reflect mgit operations, not local file access
- Configuration over hardcoding for all paths and patterns

## Workflow 8: Large-Scale Automated Delta Sync

**Goal:** The system is in a mature, production state, automatically and reliably synchronizing hundreds or thousands of repositories defined in Sync Groups.

1.  **Scheduler Trigger (System Action):**
    *   A central scheduler (like systemd, cron, or a workflow orchestrator like Airflow) runs a master `elysiactl` command on a schedule (e.g., every 15 minutes).
        ```bash
        uv run elysiactl sync --all --parallel 8
        ```

2.  **Sync Group Processing (`elysiactl`):**
    *   `elysiactl` loads all configured Sync Groups (from Workflow 7).
    *   It checks the schedule for each group and determines which ones are due to run. For example, the `critical-platform-services` group might run on this cycle, but the `data-science-libraries` group might not.

3.  **Parallel Delta Calculation (`elysiactl` -> `mgit`):**
    *   `elysiactl` initiates parallel `mgit diff` processes (up to the `--parallel 8` limit).
    *   Each `mgit` process is responsible for a subset of the due repositories. It reads their changesets, fetches updates, and generates the targeted delta stream, just like in **Workflow 2**.

4.  **Parallel Ingestion (`elysiactl` -> `Weaviate`):**
    *   As the `mgit` processes produce their JSONL streams, `elysiactl`'s own worker pool consumes them.
    *   The workers handle batching, embedding, and ingestion into Weaviate concurrently. The system is designed to handle multiple streams at once.

5.  **Monitoring and Reporting:**
    *   Throughout the process, `elysiactl` emits structured logs and metrics (e.g., to Prometheus or a log file).
        ```json
        {
          "timestamp": "...", "level": "info", "event": "sync_group_start", 
          "group": "critical-platform-services", "repo_count": 15
        }
        {
          "timestamp": "...", "level": "info", "event": "sync_repo_success", 
          "repo": "p97networks/Loyalty-Platform/ServiceA", "files_changed": 22, 
          "duration_ms": 15234
        }
        {
          "timestamp": "...", "level": "error", "event": "sync_repo_failed", 
          "repo": "pdidev/Blue-Cow/DevTools", "error": "git fetch failed: timeout"
        }
        ```
    *   Failures in one repository do not stop the entire sync run. Failed repos are logged for alerting, and their old changesets are kept, so they will be retried on the next run.

**Outcome:** The system reliably keeps a large fleet of repositories synchronized with Weaviate in a scalable, observable, and fault-tolerant manner, requiring no manual intervention for its normal operation.
