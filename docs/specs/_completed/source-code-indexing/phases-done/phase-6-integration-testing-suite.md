# Phase 6: Integration Testing Suite

## Objective

Create comprehensive integration test suite covering end-to-end workflows, performance benchmarks, error scenarios, and production readiness validation for the complete sync pipeline.

## Problem Summary

Phase 5 delivers high-performance sync capabilities but lacks systematic testing to ensure reliability at scale. Production deployments need comprehensive test coverage for all sync scenarios, performance validation, error recovery testing, and integration verification with real Weaviate clusters and enterprise data patterns.

### File: `/opt/elysiactl/tests/integration/test_performance_benchmarks.py` (EXTRACTED)

Performance benchmark tests with statistical analysis and throughput validation.

### File: `/opt/elysiactl/tests/integration/test_scenarios.py` (EXTRACTED)

Real-world scenario tests for enterprise environments including Git workflows and monorepos.

### File: `/opt/elysiactl/pytest.ini` (EXTRACTED)

## Agent Workflow

1. **Test Infrastructure Setup:**
   - Create comprehensive integration test suite covering all phases
   - Set up realistic test data generation and scenarios
   - Create performance benchmark tests with statistical analysis
   - Implement test configuration and environment management

2. **Scenario Coverage:**
   - Test end-to-end pipeline with real-world data patterns
   - Create Git workflow integration tests
   - Test monorepo and large-scale scenarios
   - Verify error resilience and recovery

3. **Performance Validation:**
   - Benchmark throughput scaling with different configurations
   - Test worker efficiency and memory usage
   - Validate optimization strategies
   - Create performance monitoring and reporting tools

4. **Production Readiness:**
   - Test signal handling and graceful shutdown
   - Verify concurrent access patterns
   - Test configuration management
   - Create comprehensive test runner and reporting

## Testing

### Run complete integration test suite:
```bash
# Run all integration tests
/opt/elysiactl/scripts/run_integration_tests.sh

# Run with verbose output
/opt/elysiactl/scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --verbose

# Run performance benchmarks
/opt/elysiactl/scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --benchmark

# Run all tests including slow ones
/opt/elysiactl/scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --slow --benchmark
```

### Run specific test categories:
```bash
# Run only performance benchmarks
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_performance_benchmarks.py -v -m benchmark

# Run scenario tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_scenarios.py -v -m integration

# Run pipeline tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_sync_pipeline.py -v
```

### Generate performance reports:
```bash
# Generate performance report from checkpoint database
python scripts/performance_report.py --db /var/lib/elysiactl/sync_checkpoints.db

# Output JSON only
python scripts/performance_report.py --json-only --db /var/lib/elysiactl/sync_checkpoints.db
```

### Test with coverage:
```bash
# Run tests with coverage reporting
/opt/elysiactl/scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --coverage
```

### Manual testing scenarios:
```bash
# Test enterprise scenario
find /opt/elysiactl -name "*.py" | head -100 | uv run elysiactl index sync --stdin --parallel --workers=4 --dry-run --verbose

# Test error handling
echo "/nonexistent/file.py" | uv run elysiactl index sync --stdin --verbose

# Test checkpoint recovery (interrupt and resume)
find /opt/elysiactl -name "*.py" | uv run elysiactl index sync --stdin --verbose
# Interrupt with Ctrl+C, then run again to test resume
```
