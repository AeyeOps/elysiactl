# Phase 2 Summary: Collection Backup & Restore

## Overview
Phase 2 implements essential collection management capabilities with a focus on reliability, safety, and user experience. By breaking down the implementation into manageable phases, we minimize risk while delivering immediate value.

## Implementation Breakdown

### Phase 2A: Schema-Only Backup (4 hours)
- âœ… Basic `col backup --schema-only` command
- âœ… JSON format with comprehensive metadata
- âœ… Dry-run support and validation
- âœ… Foundation for data backup features

### Phase 2B: Data Backup (6 hours)
- âœ… Enhanced backup with data inclusion
- âœ… Progress tracking for large operations
- âœ… Batch processing for performance
- âœ… Memory-efficient handling

### Phase 2C: Basic Restore (6 hours)
- âœ… `col restore` command for new collections
- âœ… Schema recreation from backups
- âœ… Data restoration with progress indicators
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2D: Clear + Enhanced Restore (8 hours)
- âœ… `col clear` command with safety features
- âœ… Basic merge support for existing collections
- âœ… Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- âœ… Complete core functionality
