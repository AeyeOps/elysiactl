# Phase 3: Advanced Backup & Restore Features (Roadmap)

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on advanced features that enhance the core backup/restore functionality with enterprise-grade capabilities, better performance, and additional data formats.

## Planned Features

### 1. Advanced Data Formats
**Parquet Support**
- Add Apache Parquet format for analytics workloads
- Enable column-based storage for large datasets
- Integrate with pandas/pyarrow for data manipulation
- Support for partitioned backups

**Compressed Backups**
- Gzip compression for JSON backups (60-80% size reduction)
- LZ4 for faster compression/decompression
- Automatic compression based on dataset size
- Configurable compression levels

### 2. Backup Catalog System
**Automated Catalog Management**
- SQLite-based catalog for tracking all backups
- Automatic metadata collection (size, date, source)
- Backup retention policies and cleanup
- Search and filtering capabilities

**Catalog Commands**
```bash
elysiactl col catalog list                    # List all backups
elysiactl col catalog show <backup-id>       # Show backup details
elysiactl col catalog cleanup --older-than 30d  # Remove old backups
elysiactl col catalog verify <backup-id>     # Verify backup integrity
```

### 3. Advanced Restore Capabilities
**Smart Merge Operations**
- Conflict resolution strategies (overwrite, skip, merge)
- Partial restore (specific objects/properties)
- Incremental restore with change detection
- Schema migration during restore

**Cross-Version Compatibility**
- Automatic schema migration between Weaviate versions
- Vector dimension compatibility checking
- Property type conversion and validation

### 4. Enterprise Features
**Multi-Cluster Support**
- Backup from one cluster, restore to another
- Cross-region data migration
- Secure transfer protocols
- Cluster health validation

**Parallel Processing**
- Multi-threaded backup/restore operations
- Worker pool management
- Load balancing across cluster nodes
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### 5. Monitoring & Observability
**Real-Time Monitoring**
- Progress tracking with detailed metrics
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Memory usage monitoring and alerts
- Network throughput monitoring

**Operational Dashboards**
- Backup success/failure rates over time
- Performance trends and optimization opportunities
- Storage utilization and cleanup recommendations
- Automated alerting for backup failures

### 6. Advanced Data Operations
**Selective Backup/Restore**
```bash
elysiactl col backup MyCollection --filter "created_date > '2024-01-01'"
elysiactl col restore backup.json --objects "id1,id2,id3"
elysiactl col restore backup.json --properties "title,content"
```

**Data Transformation**
- Property mapping during restore
- Data type conversion
- Content filtering and modification
- Schema transformation pipelines

## Success Criteria

### Functional Completeness
- Support for all major data formats (JSON, Parquet, compressed)
- Complete backup catalog system with automated management
- Advanced restore options including selective and incremental operations
- Multi-cluster backup/restore capabilities
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

### Performance Targets
- Parquet backup: < 50% of JSON size for large datasets
- Compressed backup: < 30% of uncompressed size
- Parallel restore: > 500 objects/second with 4 workers
- Catalog queries: < 100ms response time

### Reliability Targets
- 99.9% backup success rate for healthy clusters
- Automatic recovery from network interruptions
- Data integrity validation for all formats
- Comprehensive error reporting and diagnostics

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Format Compatibility**: Extensive testing with different data types
- **Performance Impact**: Benchmarking and optimization before release
- **Security**: Audit all network operations and data handling

### Operational Risks
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU monitoring in production
- **Failure Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and rollback
- **User Training**: Clear documentation and examples

## Dependencies
- PyArrow for Parquet support
- Additional compression libraries (lz4, zstandard)
- Enhanced error handling framework
- Performance monitoring infrastructure

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for format conversions
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Multi-cluster testing environment
- User acceptance testing with enterprise scenarios

## Rollout Plan
1. **Alpha Release**: Core advanced features (formats, catalog)
2. **Beta Release**: Enterprise features (multi-cluster, parallel)
3. **GA Release**: Full feature set with monitoring and documentation

## Metrics & KPIs
- User adoption rate of advanced features
- Performance improvement over basic features
- Support ticket reduction due to enhanced reliability
- Time-to-recovery for backup/restore operations</content>
