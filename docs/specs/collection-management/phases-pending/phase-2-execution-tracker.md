- **Performance Testing**: Large dataset testing was theoretical rather than empirical validation
- **Documentation Sync**: Some sections of tracker became outdated during rapid development

#### **Technical Debt**
- **Hardcoded Values**: Some configuration values (batch sizes, timeouts) should be configurable
- **Error Classification**: Could benefit from more granular error types and recovery strategies
- **Monitoring**: Limited runtime metrics collection for production monitoring

#### **Development Experience**
- **Test Environment Setup**: Could be more automated and reliable
- **Debugging Tools**: Limited visibility into Weaviate operations during development
- **Code Review Process**: No mention of peer review in the execution tracker
